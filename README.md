# Project Student-Development
# Introduction
 In March 2022, I decided to pursue a career in Data Science. I've operated a tutoring business for 8 years and taught math for 3 years. I am currently seeking a job in Data Science while re-branding my business. My goals follow: 
1. Determine student deficiency in order to target specific needs for growth and predict outcomes. 
2. Merge the student's evaluation with new Data Science skills to practice creating a project while marketing evidence of my growth to recruiters and potential clients.

Phase 1: Project Overview

Phase 2: Collect and Clean Data

Phase 3: Analyze Data

Phase 4: Data Model

Phase 5: Deploy Project
# Phase 1: Project Overview
During this phase, I’ll identify the project’s problem and discuss the action plan. For privacy, I’ll call the student Bill, although that is not the student’s legal name. 
Bill is an 8th-grade student who takes Algebra. I’ve tutored him for two years, and during that time, I discovered that he struggles to grasp and retain complex mathematical concepts. Moreover, he lacks foundational arithmetic skills. Bill is an eager learner who wants to develop but also struggles to stay engaged in a typical math classroom setting. After I hesitated to undergo a complete analysis of him, I decided that it was necessary for him to reach his full potential while maximizing time. I hypothesize that the results from this analysis will allow me, the student, his parents, and teachers to anticipate his upcoming struggles and gain a precise understanding of the skills he needs to improve in math. 

# Phase 2: Collect and Clean Data
Over eight weeks, Bill completed fifteen 6th-8th grade, math diagnostic assessments on Edulastic. During our weekly, virtual tutoring sessions, the following domains were examined.

NBT- Numbers & Operations in Base Ten

M & D- Measurement and Data 

NF- Number and Operations-Fractions

OA- Operations & Algebraic Thinking 

RP- Ratios and Proportions 

EE- Expressions and Equations 

G- Geometry 

SP- Statistics and Probability 

In order to identify the information I needed for Bill's individual analysis report, I had to consider the information I wanted to present. Therefore, I asked myself a questions; Some are listed below. This report will provide quantative and qualatative data.

A. Quantatative Data:

1. At what grade level did I notice a gap in Bill's math retention and how large is this descrepency? 
2. In which standard(s) did I notice the greatest or least gap?
3. Can I make predictions about his performance in future math classes based off of these findings?
4. How can I quickly target Bill's specific needs after I have his report?
5. Is bill struggling or accelerating within the same standard throughout grade levels?

B. Qualatative Data:

1. How can I present Bill's visually, clearly and quickly? I want the student, teachers and parents to have an at-glance look at Bill's specific strengths, weaknesses and needs. 


side note: Collecting data was important to I will be able to get a more precise understanding of the skills that he needs in order to improve.

Now that 
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bnw-9ivbeo Here is a link to a short video that explains what clean "good" data is in less than 15 minutes. Because I found this information very useful, I will be undergoing my first attempt to clean the data located in the spreadsheet posted above. This video stands out to me because it is short, clear and appears to be stright forward. I want to test if the information I learned in this video will suffice in my data cleaning stage. In other words, will I be able to upload "good" data into a database, Power BI, after my first cleaning attempt? Results are below.
