# Student-Development
# In March 2022, I decided to pursue a career in Data Science. I've operated a tutoring business for 8 years and taught math for 3 years. I am currently seeking a job in Data Science while re-branding my business. My goals for this project are listed below. 1. Determine student deficiency in order to target specific needs for growth and predict outcomes. 2. Merge the student's evaluation with new Data Science skills to practice creating a project while marketing evidence of my growth to recruiters and potential clients.

# I plan to complete this project in 5 stages starting 5/27/2022 and ending 6/3/2022. 
# Phase 1: Project Overview
# Phase 2: Collect and Clean Data  
# Phase 3: Analyze Data
# Phase 4: Data Model
# Phase 5: Deploy Project

# Here’s an update to my Student Development Project 
# During this phase, I’ll identify the project’s problem and discuss the action plan. For privacy, we’ll call the student Bill, although that is not the student’s legal name.

# Bill is an 8th-grade student who takes Algebra. I’ve tutored him for two years, and during that time, I discovered that he struggles to grasp and retain complex mathematical concepts. Moreover, he lacks foundational arithmetic skills. Bill is an eager learner who wants to develop but also struggles to stay engaged in a typical math classroom setting. After I hesitated to undergo a complete analysis of him, I decided that it was necessary for him to reach his full potential while maximizing time. I hypothesize that the results from this analysis will allow me, the student, his parents, and teachers to anticipate his upcoming struggles and gain a precise understanding of the skills he needs to improve in math.
