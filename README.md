# Student-Development
In March 2022, I decided to pursue a career in Data Science. I've operated a tutoring business for 8 years and taught math for 3 years. I am currently seeking a job in Data Science while re-branding my business. My goals for this project are listed below. 1. Determine student deficiency in order to target specific needs for growth and predict outcomes. 2. Merge the student's evaluation with new Data Science skills to practice creating a project while marketing evidence of my growth to recruiters and potential clients.![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105477139/170617972-ebefc924-f3b9-4268-8945-25c8a7b6a8ac.JPG)
