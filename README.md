# Project Student-Development
# Introduction
 In March 2022, I decided to pursue a career in Data Science. I've operated a tutoring business for 8 years and taught math for 3 years. I am currently seeking a job in Data Science while re-branding my business. My goals follow: 
1. Determine student deficiency in order to target specific needs for growth and predict outcomes. 
2. Merge the student's evaluation with new Data Science skills to practice creating a project while marketing evidence of my growth to recruiters and potential clients.

Phase 1: Project Overview

Phase 2: Collect and Clean Data

Phase 3: Analyze Data

Phase 4: Data Model

Phase 5: Deploy Project
# Phase 1
During this phase, I’ll identify the project’s problem and discuss the action plan. For privacy, I’ll call the student Bill, although that is not the student’s legal name.

Bill is an 8th-grade student who takes Algebra. I’ve tutored him for two years, and during that time, I discovered that he struggles to grasp and retain complex mathematical concepts. Moreover, he lacks foundational arithmetic skills. Bill is an eager learner who wants to develop but also struggles to stay engaged in a typical math classroom setting. After I hesitated to undergo a complete analysis of him, I decided that it was necessary for him to reach his full potential while maximizing time. I hypothesize that the results from this analysis will allow me, the student, his parents, and teachers to anticipate his upcoming struggles and gain a precise understanding of the skills he needs to improve in math. 
# Here is a like to the data. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1cyhR_83vV6k1KQBRlekau0TLh0IJWKE04QCZ5lhzI/edit#gid=0 #This data will be updated regularly 
# Now that all of the data is located into the spreadsheet, I will clean the data. Updaes are below.
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bnw-9ivbeo Here is a link to a short video that explains what clean "good" data is in less than 15 minutes. Because I found this information very useful, I will be undergoing my first attempt to clean the data located in the spreadsheet posted above. This video stands out to me because it is short, clear and appears to be stright forward. I want to test if the information I learned in this video will suffice in my data cleaning stage. In other words, will I be able to upload "good" data into a database, Power BI, after my first cleaning attempt? Results are below.
